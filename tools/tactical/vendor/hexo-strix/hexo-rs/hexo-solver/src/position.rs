//! Arbitrary-position loader for the solver. Not required to be a reachable
//! game position — supports boards that could not arise in a real game.
//!
//! [`SolverPosition`] mirrors [`prover::io::Position`] but is the public,
//! WASM-facing type. [`solve_from_position`] dispatches across [`SolverEngine`]
//! (Idtt/Pns/Dfpn/Pdspn):
//!
//! - **Idtt** (the default, production iterative-deepening solver) takes a
//!   *board-level* path: it builds a [`forcing::SolverBoard`] directly from the
//!   stones (via [`SolverPosition::to_solver_board`]) and calls
//!   [`forcing::solve_from_board`]. This never constructs a `GameState`, so it
//!   works for **fully arbitrary** boards — including ones missing the
//!   `(0,0,P1)` origin stone that `GameState::from_state` requires.
//! - **Dfpn / Pdspn / Pns** (the deep proof-search drivers) build their shared
//!   [`prover::kernel::KernelCtx`] from the stones directly (so the *search* is
//!   arbitrary-board safe), but their PV reconstruction routes through
//!   [`prover::io::Position::to_game`] → `GameState::from_state`, which seeds an
//!   origin `(0,0,P1)` stone. For a position lacking that origin the resulting
//!   `GameState` does not match the input stones (and a `(0,0,P2)` stone would
//!   panic on the collision). Deep provers therefore require a *game-valid*
//!   position (the `(0,0,P1)` origin present); for a position that is not
//!   game-valid they return [`Outcome::BudgetExceeded`] — an honest give-up, never
//!   a bogus verdict. Use Idtt for arbitrary boards.
